# HourGlass
This is a repository that houses the classes and final product of the counsellor time management application I designed to assist my school's counsellors. 
Currently, only the jar product is available. The src folder is currently unavailable as it is being reviewed by an educational board and cannot be released for
distribution as of yet. The .txt file is also necessary for application use as the application employs the use of serialization and deserialization protocols.
